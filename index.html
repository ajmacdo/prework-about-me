      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Excited to gain coding skills!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in the Bay View neighborhood of Milwaukee and Oak Creek.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include yoga, running, cooking, spending time with family and friends, and stalking animal rescue websites until I move into a building that allows pets.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would magically combine my interests and experiences in journalism and environmental issues, as well as my fancy new coding skills.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the downtown Milwaukee area.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've been learning to code for the past few years, but need more structure and support to make progress past basic html and css; I've learned enough to know that I enjoy it, but not enough to apply skills in a real-world way. There are a lot of things I appreciate about my current job, but the bottom line is that I need to earn more, and I'd love to learn enough web development skills to pursue a new career direction with them.</p>
